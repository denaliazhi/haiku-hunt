- `DATABASE_NAME` to connect to the postgreSQL database
- `DATABASE_PWD` to connect to the postgreSQL database
- `DATABASE_USER` to connect to the postgreSQL database
- `SECRET` to set up the session (see `app.js`)
- `APP_USER`/`APP_USER2`/`APP_PWD`/`APP_PWD2` to populate the initial users table (see `initialUsers.js`)

#### üî® Known issues
If I were to revisit this project at a later date, I'd want to address the following:
- When submitting a haiku, the user may get an error stating that a line doesn't match the expected syllabic count, but it actually does. The language library that is used to validate this information mistakes certain instances where a word is pronounced with fewer syllables than its spelling suggests.
- This project currently runs on a free database service with limited compute time. Once the 5h limit is reached, only the home, about, and sign-in pages are rendered. All other pages depend on queries to the database, so they will return error messages.
- When a user unsaves a poem from their dashboard, the user is redirected to the landmark details page for the poem that they just unsaved. Ideally, the user should remain on their dashboard after unsaving a poem.
