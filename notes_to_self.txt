1. When formatting INSERT statement use %L not `${}` 
to dynamically insert values. The former escapes single 
quotes whereas the latter does not. If a string has an 
apostrophe, the latter will fail due to mismatch in '.

2. When INSERT, must specify columns to update in ()
to prevent attempt to assign value to the first column,
which is the ID auto-generated column

3. Order of column names must be the same between the 
CREATE TABLE and INSERT statements if the columns to be updated
via INSERT are not explicitly in ()

4. `SELECT DISTINCT *` returns duplicates because the id column is unique

5. Connect to SQL database from command line via 
`psl "postgres://koyeb-adm:npg_G0j4gmtfcVxz@ep-billowing-pine-a4jql561.us-east-1.pg.koyeb.app/koyebdb"`

6. Express validator: can create custom validations,
apply validations to all using body(*), sanitize last

7. Left join will cause 'id' column to be null if both tables have 'id' column 
i.e. fountains with 'id' and clues with 'id' but joining on 'fountainsId'
